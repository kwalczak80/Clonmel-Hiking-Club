# **Design**
<ul>
<li><strong>Colour Scheme</strong></li>
<ul>
  <li>The colors used on the website are to be in line with the theme of hiking in the mountains. The appropriate shade of colors on the page ensures that there are no large contrasts between the individual sections of the page.</li>
  <li>I have used <a href="https://coolors.co">Coolors</a> to come up with a color scheme. I used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient and there is no issues with website  readability.</li>

![Responsive Design](docs/main-website-colors.PNG "Main website colors")
<ul>
  <li>#9BA37E is the main background color for the menu section.</li>
  <li>#D9DDC9 is the main background color for the body of the website.</li>
  <li>#EBEBEC is the main backgroung color for the contact form input fields.</li>
  <li>#000000 is the main color for all text information displayed on the webpage.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typography</strong></li>
<ul>
  <li>I vistied <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts </a> website to explore available font options for my project. After consideration I selected two font types as appropirate.</li>

When viewing this website on large screens, the text information is grouped into three columns and two rows.

# **Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section**
<ul>
<li>First-time user</li>
<ul>
<li>As a first-time user I would like to easily understand what the website is about</li>
<ul>
<li>After starting the website, the user is immediately displayed a navigation bar with the name of the club and a menu bar under which there is a photo inspiring hiking. The name of the club clearly explains the content of this page</li>
</ul>
<li>As a first-time user I would like to easily navigate throughout the website content</li>
<ul>
<li>The site navigation is very simple and intuitive. The menu bar is permanently stuck at the top of the page, allowing the user to quickly switch between the individual sections of the page. In addition, all links in the menu precisely define the individual sections of the page and highlight their name upon hover. To speed up operation, the page automatically scrolls its content to the section selected by the user.</li>
</ul>
<li>As a first-time user I would like to read information about the Clonmel Hiking Club</li>
<ul>
<li>The about us section very clearly and briefly describes what the Clonmel hiking club is and inspires website visitors to join its group.</li>
</ul>
<li>As a first-time user I would like to easily read the text information displayed on the webpage regardless of the device screen size I'm using</li>
<ul>
<li>The club website allows the user to display its content on various screens of mobile phones, tablets, iPads, laptops and desktops. The layout of the page content changes dynamically depending on the resolution of the screen on which the page is displayed</li>
</ul>
<li>As a first-time user I would like to find other interesting information I'm looking for</li>
<ul>
<li>The website has been divided into thematic sections where the user can find interesting information. The content of each section has been designed to be easily readable and to convey as much information as possible. In addition, the sticky menu bar helps in quickly navigation through the page content</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Returning User</li>
<ul>
<li>As a returning user I would like to find more information about the club in social media channels</li>
<ul>
<li>The user has a choice of four available Clonmel Hiking Club social channels to visit. Social channels are a very important part of the website because they allow the user to contact other club members or exchange information. Each of the selected social pages is displayed in a separate tab, which allows user  to quickly return to the club's website.</li>
</ul>
<li>As a returning user I would like to be able to use the contact form to send a message regarding my inquiries</li>
<ul>
<li>The contact section is very simple to use and requires a minimum amount of information that the user has to enter in order to send a message.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Frequent User</li>
<ul><li>As a frequent user I would like to check if the gallery has been updated with new photos that might inspire me for hiking trips,</li>
<ul>
<li>
Photos in the gallery section are almost the most important pillar of this website. They allow the user to check the club's activities and can be a source of inspiration. In addition, the regular addition of new photos by club members can significantly encourage the user to visit the site frequently</li>
</ul>
<li>As a frequent user I would like to find information about upcoming events that might be suitable for me,</li>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Upcoming Events section contains information about the currently planned hiking trip. It is presented in a very simple way by means of a short text information and an interactive google map with the exact location of the event. If interested, the user can always use the contact form to obtain additional information about the trip.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

## **User Experience (UX) Testing Results**
<ul>
<li>After this website was designed , a link to the project was sent to my friends and true hiking enthusiasts with the request to test the website and to express general opinion about the website's appearance, content and its functionality. The feedback I got was very positive. The opinions expressed the fact that the website is very legible and easy to use. Some small bugs related mostly to the typo errors were corrected immediately.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<hr>

# **Bugs**
### **Solved Bugs**
<ul>
<li>When project was deployed to Github I noticed that images in gallery section were not displayed correctly. To fix the issue I went to GitPod application and I right clicked on each picture to obtain a copy of relative path. Once the code was updated and pushed to Github this problem was no longer an issue.</li>
<li>During the design process I noticed that some elements in the footer section were not correctly positioned on the page. This was related to divs overflow. To quickly locate the problem I used Unicorn Revealer in order to make relavant corrections in the code.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

# **Website Performance**
<ul>
  <li>During the Lighthouse testing I discovered that the website performance result was quite low(69%). This was related to size of the pictures(static) displayed in the gallery section. In order to improve the website overall performance the following steps were performed:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Size all pictures was reduced to 600x400px,</li>
  <li>DPI was reduced from 300 to 72,</li>
  <li>All pictures were converted from JPG to WEBP using WEBP Converter</li>
</ul>
  <li>All links to the pragrams that were used to complete setps above can be found in <strong>Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used</strong> section of this document</li>
</ul>
