# **Bugs**
### **Solved Bugs**
<ul>
<li>
When project was deployed to Github I noticed that images in gallery section were not displayed correctly. To fix the issue I went to GitPod application and I right clicked on each picture to obtain a copy of relative path. Once the code was updated and pushed to Github this problem was no longer an issue.
</li>
<li>
During the Lighthouse testing I discovered that the website performance result was quite low(69%). This was related to size of the pictures(static) displayed in the gallery section. In order to improve the website overall performance the following steps were performed:
<ul>
<li>Size all pictures was reduced to 600x400px,</li>
<li>DPI was reduced from 300 to 72,</li>
<li>All pictures were converted from JPG to WEBP using WEBP Converter</li>
</ul>
