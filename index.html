            <p> Here are some reasons why hikining
                can
                improve your life.</p>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Health and well-being</h3>
                    <p>Walking is an excellent way to maintain fitness and general health. Studies show that even a
                        short
                        walk
                        outside for 20 minutes can reduce stress and boost your immune system. It also does wonders for
                        clearing
                        your mind and stimulating creativity. Thanks to its low-impact nature, it is also suitable for
                        most
                        abilities, and requires minimal equipment. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Learn something</h3>
                    <p>Whether it is learning how to identify an unknown summit on the horizon, or a rare bird perched
                        on a
                        tree,
                        there is always something to learn out on the trails. Multiple books and apps can help with
                        self-learning,
                        but there is something to be said for the knowledge and skills of a qualified guide to
                        accelerate
                        the
                        learning process.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>A Different Kind of High</h3>
                    <p>Hiking offers a different kind of high. A high not associated with drugs or alcohol or going out
                        to
                        the
                        clubs and staying up all night partying. Hiking offers a surreal sense of accomplishment and an
                        adrenaline rush. It increases your dopamine and serotonin levels (happy hormones) in a healthy
                        way.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Nature bathing</h3>
                    <p>Nature is benefits to health are well documented. The Japanese even have a term for it:
                        Shinrin-yoko
                        (taking
                        in the forest atmosphere or forest bathing), with doctors prescribing it as a treatment for all
                        kinds of
                        health issues. Time spent in nature can be an excellent way of relaxing and uncluttering your
                        mind.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Meet friends: old and new</h3>
                    <p>Walking on your own can be very therapeutic, but it is also an excellent social activity! Joining
                        an
                        organised walking trip can lead to new friendships through an inspiring shared experience.
                        Something
                        you
                        can
                        then plan to do as friends, with your family, independently, or on another group tour.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h3>Challenges Your Limits</h3>
                    <p>Hiking offers a sense of competition without competing with anyone else, only yourself. It is not
                        a
                        meant
                        to be a race with the person hiking next to you, but rather an interpersonal challenge set to
                        your
                        own
                        capabilities. It may not be a physical challenge for some, but also a mental, and spiritual
                        challenge.
